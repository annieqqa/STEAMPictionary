# STEAMPictionary (In progress, stay tuned!)
A Fun and Engaging Way to Learn STEAM Concepts with Friends.

## Inspiration
Quite often, introductions of STEAM concepts are usually passive.
This is where STEAMPictionary comes in- making learning more fun and interactive through gamifying the process and actively engaging users to formulate their own interpretation of STEAM concepts.

## What it does
The game is very similar to the traditional Pictionary game, except that the words to be guessed are STEAM jargons. One drawer is selected from the group of players who tries to depict the concept of the jargon through drawing, while the rest of the players guess the word. Users can go to the revision room to review the words learnt.

## How we built it
The game is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is built with the package socket.io and nodemon.

## What's next for STEAMPictionary
Allow user-defined study sets, enhance web appearance through collaboration with web designer friends, allow users to store their progress in an account.
