# STEAMPictionary
A Fun and Engaging Way to Learn STEAM Concepts with Friends.

## Inspiration
Quite often, introductions of STEAM concepts are usually passive.
This is where STEAMPictionary comes in- making learning more fun and interactive through gamifying the process and actively engaging users to formulate their own interpretation of STEAM concepts.

## What it does
The game is very similar to the traditional Pictionary game, except that the words to be guessed are STEAM jargons. One drawer is selected from the group of players who tries to depict the concept of the jargon through drawing, while the rest of the players guess the word. Users can go to the revision room to review the words learnt.

## How we built it
The game is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is built with the package socket.io and nodemon.

## Challenges we ran into
A client-server network has to be established in order to make this multi-player game, which is completely new to me. To achieve this, I watched youtube tutorials, read documentations and researched similar github projects, finally deciding to use socket.io and took reference from existing pictionary games such as skribbl.io.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It is my first time building a client-server network and it is really fascinating to create a working multiplayer game.

## What we learned
I definitely learnt a lot more about Javascript concepts such as querySelectors and event listeners through this hands on project, and my knowledge of client-server network is also strengthened through working with socket.io.

## What's next for STEAMPictionary
Allow user-defined study sets, enhance web appearance through collaboration with web designer friends, allow users to store their progress in an account.
